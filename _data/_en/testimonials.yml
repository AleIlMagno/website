  position: "Consultant"
  text: "I Worked with Henry over 6 sessions and enjoyed the process. I learned a lot along the journey and got a sense of where all my data is floating around and who has access to it. I work at a consulting company and wanted to be protected from competitors. Although there was a big time zone difference between us we could always find the right time. I can just recommend working with him if you want the shortcut, the faster way to a better privacy. I didn’t have that much time and the time I had while working a lot I didn’t wanna invest in researching every little detail."
