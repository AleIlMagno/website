title: "Proton released...a Bitcoin wallet ðŸ¤¨"
description: "Proton just released Proton Wallet, a Bitcoin-only wallet, while still advertising itself as a privacy-first company. I (and many others) are very confused behind the new release and what it means for Proton's mission as a whole. I dive into my initial thoughts, this is not a proper review, that's something I may do in the future if you all want it!"
